[00:02] We are approaching giving Tuesday. It's
[00:05] a day about giving back to causes and
[00:07] organizations that mean a lot to you.
[00:10] And for the United Way of Marquette
[00:11] County, there are a lot of causes that
[00:14] you know the United Way takes part in
[00:16] many partner agencies. Joining us in the
[00:19] studio this morning, we have my co-chair
[00:21] for the United Way of Marquette County's
[00:23] campaign this year, Jesse Renfor. Thank
[00:25] you for being here.
[00:26] Yeah, of course. Thanks, Becca.
[00:27] Yes. And so today we're talking about
[00:29] the need. Uh there's a great need for
[00:33] this time of year, you know, whatever it
[00:35] may be. And a lot of people they address
[00:37] food, food insecurity, you know,
[00:40] stocking the shelves, but with United
[00:42] Way of Marquet County, there is so many
[00:45] needs. Correct.
[00:46] I think that's exactly it. I mean, the
[00:48] fact that we kind of oversee 26
[00:50] different agencies, we have a different
[00:52] vantage point. we're able to see kind of
[00:54] where some of these holes are and where
[00:56] we can kind of plug some of these holes.
[00:57] So, that's kind of what we're doing
[00:58] right now to your point, food insecurity
[01:00] is real and it's real serious right now.
[01:03] Um, but there's some other programs that
[01:04] really desperately need some help as
[01:06] well,
[01:06] right? Yes. And whether it's child care,
[01:09] you know, just rides, you know, for the
[01:11] elderly to the doctors, to the grocery
[01:13] store, just for them to get their basic
[01:15] items. I mean, it's things that people
[01:17] don't even think about that we take for
[01:19] granted, right?
[01:20] Absolutely. and we're becoming more and
[01:22] more aware of what's happening in our
[01:24] community and it's unfortunately going
[01:26] kind of in a in a backwards direction.
[01:28] So, we really need to dig deep right now
[01:30] and really help each other out.
[01:31] Yes. And the United Way of Marquet
[01:32] County has 26 partner agencies um
[01:37] covering all different field fields of
[01:39] people in vulnerable states, you know.
[01:42] So, right now, the United Way of
[01:44] Marquette County has a give a Tuesday
[01:46] campaign going on to address, you know,
[01:48] beyond the can, beyond the pantry
[01:52] donations, things like that. Right.
[01:54] That's exactly it. And, you know, we're
[01:55] going to kind of get a jump start on it
[01:56] as well. We're going to kind of do this
[01:58] early bird kind of situation because we
[02:00] just can't wait around. We can't wait
[02:02] until, you know, Giving Tuesday. Uh
[02:04] there's that's weeks in between. That's
[02:05] valuable time and we need to get people
[02:07] on their feet. So,
[02:08] yes, for sure. Especially this time of
[02:10] year. And the best way to do that is by
[02:12] going to wmqt.org.
[02:14] There's a donation page right there
[02:16] where you can find all that information
[02:18] on how to donate. Jesse, is there
[02:20] anything else you think people should
[02:21] know, you know, leading up to Giving
[02:23] Tuesday, leading up to this holiday
[02:25] season about giving back?
[02:26] I think it's really important to first
[02:28] of all check on our neighbors, right?
[02:29] Make sure we're keeping track of each
[02:31] other. And then how can we, you know,
[02:33] make that donation? How can we help grow
[02:36] our community, get them where they need
[02:38] to be? Um, and again, United Way
[02:40] covering the multiple agencies the way
[02:42] that we do kind of is a one-stop
[02:44] shopping and allows us to kind of get
[02:46] those funds to people that really need
[02:47] it and with the most efficiency as well.
[02:50] All right. And another thing I did want
[02:51] to touch on too is, you know, if money
[02:54] buying things, it's not, you know, if
[02:57] you can't make that happen, there's also
[02:59] United.com,
[03:01] a portal where you can have a variety of
[03:03] different volunteer options that best
[03:05] suit you.
[03:06] That's exactly it. time, talent or
[03:08] treasure, right? There's something you
[03:09] can do. Maybe you have some time you can
[03:10] give up this time of year. There's a lot
[03:12] of programs that could also use some
[03:13] hours. So,
[03:14] yes. And we will have all that
[03:15] information for you on either how to
[03:17] give back on Giving Tuesday, how to
[03:19] volunteer, everything that United Way of
[03:21] Marquette County is a part of on our
[03:23] website, myupp.com. Jesse, thank you so
[03:26] much for joining us this morning.
[03:27] Thanks for having me.
[03:27] Yes. And stay with us. We'll be right
[03:29] back with more MyUP Mornings after the
