  text: "It is a complex term for a population we know too well. ALICE is working hard, but barely surviving and definitely not thriving. ALICE is part of our economic engine but ALICE is struggling. ALICE may be a college student, working and going to school hoping for a better life or a senior citizen making a difficult choice between food, housing and prescriptions. ALICE could be a working dad, with childcare, transportation and housing costs that leave very little to provide shoes for his children. ALICE is many of us. ",
