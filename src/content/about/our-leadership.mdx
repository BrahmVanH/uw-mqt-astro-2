## 2025-26 Campaign Co-Chairs

 Rebecca Bartelme  and Jesse Renfors

Rebecca Bartelme and Jesse Renfors bring a dynamic combination of media expertise 
and entrepreneurial leadership to their roles as United Way of Marquette County's 
2025-26 Campaign Co-Chairs. Rebecca serves as the anchor of My UP Mornings weekdays 
from 5-7 am on WBUP (ABC) and Assistant News Director, having built her career from 
news reporter to evening anchor since joining WJMN-TV in March 2017. A University of 
Wisconsin-Platteville graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Media Studies, she moved 
to the Upper Peninsula in 2017 and has embraced it as her home and community. Jesse 
is a dedicated community leader and entrepreneur who returned to Marquette from Wyoming 
to establish Provisions MQT in spring 2022. Originally from Negaunee, he previously 
operated Cody Coffee Roaster before moving back home to the UP, where Provisions MQT 
now serves as more than a coffee shop - it's a community gathering space offering 
gelato, cooking classes, and events in the Founder's Landing development. Both 
Rebecca and Jesse are deeply committed to community service: Rebecca through her involvement 
with non-profits like the Mariucci Family Beacon House, Special Olympics and the Women's Center, 
while Jesse demonstrates his dedication through youth development as a coach for local sports 
organizations including the 906 Adventure team and Marquette and Cody Junior Hockey programs, 
and through his board service with organizations such as the Yellowstone Recreation Foundation 
and membership on the NMU Hospitality Leadership Advisory Committee.
