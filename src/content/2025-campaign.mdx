  Every day in Marquette County, neighbors are helping neighbors build a stronger, more resilient community. Through our
  2025 campaign, United Way of Marquette County continues this tradition of caring, bringing together generous hearts
  and dedicated partners to address our community's most pressing needs. With your support, we're making a real
  difference in the lives of more than 16,000 friends and neighbors—that's 1 out of every 4 Marquette County residents.

  <h2>Your Impact in Action</h2>
  <p>
    The numbers tell an inspiring story of community care and collective action. In 2024, United Way of Marquette County
    facilitated about $1.5 million of impact in our community—a remarkable 40% increase from the previous year. This
    growth reflects not just increased funding, but expanded partnerships and innovative approaches to addressing local
    challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you contribute to our annual campaign, you're not just making a donation—you're investing in solutions that
    touch every corner of our community, from ensuring families have enough to eat to providing safe spaces for children
    to learn and grow.

  <h2>Addressing Critical Community Needs</h2>
  <p>
    Food insecurity affects about 40% of Marquette County households—a sobering reminder of the challenges our neighbors
    face. Through our network of partner agencies and community collaborations, we're responding with both immediate
    relief and long-term solutions. In 2024 alone, mobile food pantries delivered 493,593 meals throughout Marquette
    County.
  </p>
  <p>
    But our impact extends far beyond food assistance. Through our network of 30 trusted partner agencies, we're
    tackling challenges ranging from housing instability to educational barriers, from healthcare access to emergency
    relief.

  <h2>Special Campaigns Making Extra Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Throughout 2025, we've launched special initiatives that bring our community together around shared goals. From the
    TV6 Canathon that mobilizes the entire Upper Peninsula to collect food for local pantries, to our partnership with
    DoorDash that delivers supplies directly to families who need them most—these campaigns showcase the incredible
    power of community collaboration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our holiday programs, including the Giving Tree and Adopt a Family initiatives, ensure that the magic of the season
    reaches every child in our community. These efforts remind us that when we work together, no family has to face
    hardship alone.
  </p>

    deep community connections to address different aspects of human need. From the American Red Cross and Big Brothers
    Big Sisters to local organizations like the Janzen House and Lake Superior Village Youth and Family Center, our
