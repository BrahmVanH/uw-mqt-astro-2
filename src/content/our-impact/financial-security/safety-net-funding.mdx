**The Safety Net Fund will support local nonprofit agencies who provide direct support services in the community by filling _an emergent and unexpected need_ in the organization.** This may include expenses in response to emergency events or natural disasters, but also includes unexpected opportunities to advance agency programming not previously in the budget. The key factor is the _unexpected_ nature of the needed funds.
