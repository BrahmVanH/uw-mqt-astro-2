  <h2>Commissioned by a Legend, Created by a Master</h2>
  <p>
    "Wings of Glory" was commissioned by Hockey Hall of Famer Dino Ciccarelli and the Detroit Red Wings Alumni
    Association specifically for the 2013 Maple Leafs vs. Red Wings Alumni Showdown. Artist Ed LaPere masterfully
    captured the spirit of that historic event, creating renderings of every participating player in stunning detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn't a mass-produced poster—it's a legitimate limited-edition lithograph, a fine art printing technique that
    ensures exceptional quality and longevity. Each piece is individually numbered as part of the exclusive 100-print
    run.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Signed by Hockey Royalty</h2>
  <p>
    What elevates this lithograph from remarkable to extraordinary is the collection of signatures it bears. Each
    participating player from the 2013 Alumni Showdown has personally signed this piece, and every one was selected for
    either their Hockey Hall of Fame status or their name being engraved on the Stanley Cup as a Detroit Red Wing.
