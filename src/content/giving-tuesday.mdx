<div class="col-span-2">
  This year, United Way of Marquette County is launching a revitalized GivingTuesday campaign focused on the whole 
  community — ensuring that families have access not only to food, but to the full range of supports that sustain 
  dignity, stability, and well-being. Our message is clear: **"GivingTuesday came early — because our community's 
  needs can't wait."**

  <h2>Beyond the Food Pantry</h2>
  <p>
    While many resources this season are flowing toward food insecurity, United Way has a broader vantage point. 
    We see that behind every meal served are families also facing challenges with housing, childcare, transportation, 
    healthcare, mental health, and senior care.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Campaign Co-Chair Jesse Renfors explains, "The fact that we oversee 26 different agencies gives us 
    a different vantage point. We're able to see where some of these holes are and where we can 
    plug some of these holes."

  <h2>Why We Started Early</h2>
  <p>
    "We're going to get a jump start on it as well," says Co-Chair Jesse Renfors. "We're going to 
    do this early bird situation because we just can't wait around. We can't wait until 
    Giving Tuesday. That's weeks in between. That's valuable time and we need to get people on their feet."
  </p>
  <p>
    We're becoming more and more aware of what's happening in our community and it's unfortunately going in 
    a backwards direction. That's why we really need to dig deep right now and help each other out.

  <h2>Smart Giving for Maximum Impact</h2>
  <p>
    When you give to United Way of Marquette County, your dollars go where they're needed most — across food, 
    housing, health, and human services. United Way covering the multiple agencies the way that we do 
    "is like one-stop shopping and allows us to get those funds to people that really need it with 
    the most efficiency as well."

    As Co-Chair Rebecca Bartelme emphasizes, "time, talent or treasure, right? There's something you can do." 
    Whether you can make a financial donation or have some time you can give up this season, there are 
    programs that could use your support.
